# FizzBuzz

Given a number N, print out all the numbers from 1 to N but when a number is divisible by 3 print out "Fizz" instead of the number, and when a number is divisible by 5 print out "Buzz" instead of the number. For numbers divisible by both 3 and 5 print "Fizz Buzz".

Ex

```go
FizzBuzz(1)
// 1
FizzBuzz(5)
// 1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz
FizzBuzz(15)
// 1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, Fizz Buzz
```
